# üîç Streamflow Analysis Using Machine Learning and Global Datasets (ERA5 + GloFAS)

This repository contains the code, methodology, and scripts required for hydrological analysis of streamflow using machine learning techniques. The approach combines reanalysis climate data (ERA5/ERA5-Land) and streamflow data from the CEMS GloFAS v4.0 global forecasting system. The main goal is to reconstruct and model discharge time series in poorly gauged regions, enabling robust water resource assessment.

## üß† Modeling Approach

The modeling workflow follows a structured pipeline to estimate river discharge using machine learning techniques driven by global climate reanalysis data:

1. **Climate and Discharge Data Preprocessing**  
   - Monthly aggregation of ERA5-Land variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature, radiation, wind)  
   - Extraction and temporal alignment of streamflow series from GloFAS v4.0  
   - Temporal normalization: shifting monthly dates to the first day and removing anomalies  
   - Spatial operations: clipping to basin geometry or selecting nearest pixel to pour point

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Construction of feature matrices from gridded climate data  
   - Optional dimensionality reduction using PCA (configurable variance threshold)  
   - Training regression models: e.g., Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, XGBoost  
   - Evaluation using hydrological metrics:  
     - NSE (Nash‚ÄìSutcliffe Efficiency)  
     - R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)  
     - PBIAS (Percent Bias)  
     - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)  
   - Automated selection and saving of the best-performing model

3. **Discharge Prediction from New Climate Data**  
   - Application of trained models on new or future climate datasets  
   - Output: simulated monthly streamflow series with performance visualization  
   - Comparison with observed series using scatter plots, time series, and cumulative flow curves  
   - Model and results exported to disk for reproducibility

Each of these steps is encapsulated in modular Python functions within the `SWIM.py` module, ensuring flexibility and reusability.
